# One-Page-Portfolio-Site
I vibe coded a one-page portfolio site using Figma and Claude. The process taught me a lot about the new efficiencies and constraints presented by the ability to integrate my own creative design choices with Claude's coding ability. The site features text, social links, animations, and a modern, design-forward aesthetic, which developed over the course of nearly 100 iterations created with prompting in Claude.<br><br>While I began the process by creating a basic site layout and prototype in Figma, the final version resembles the original in content only. Once I uploaded the original layout to Claude, I learned quickly to let go of my desire to control every aspect of the final outcome. As soon as I stopped trying to steer Claude back toward my original design, and began working with it to mold its version of my design into something even better than the original, I started to see results I was really happy with. <br><br>While I still have work to do to master creative collaboration with Claude (I still haven't gotten it to add images to my site), I can definitely see its promise.
